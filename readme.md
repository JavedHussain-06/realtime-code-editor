# Real-Time Code Editor

This project is a real-time code editor built using React, Socket.io, and CSS. It allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on code editing tasks. Users can see each other's changes in real-time and communicate through a chat feature.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a fast and efficient way to create dynamic web applications.

- **Socket.io**: Socket.io is used for real-time communication between clients and the server. It enables real-time collaboration by allowing clients to send and receive messages instantly.

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the user interface, making the code editor visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Users can collaborate on code editing tasks in real-time. Any changes made by one user are immediately visible to others.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: The code editor includes syntax highlighting for various programming languages, making it easier for users to write and understand code.
